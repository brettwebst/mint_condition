    [know the issues with the card]

    There is a $5b market for sports memorabilia, and a problem at the 
    heart that can be solved with data. The largest market is for trading
    cards, the value of which depends highly on condition. But this is 
    very hard to assess for amateurs who are the vast majority of the 
    market. So for example, what condition is this card in?

2. [[Pictures of how we solve this now]]

    We solve this now in two ways, neither of which are very effective.
    Primarily, we argue about it, but we're neither accurate nor likely
    to agree, reducing the accuracy of our evaluation and likelihood to 
    agree to trade. Expert evaluation is possible but much too costly
    and time-intensive for the vast majority of transactions.

3. [[Picture of CNN model]]

    We can solve this problem with data. We can use pictures of cards 
    to teach a model how humans have historically graded cards, and, 
    since it's a perceptual problem, we would expect ML models to be 
    good at it. I did this by using ### cards from Ebay auctions that
    have verified professional grades, and fine-tuning a CNN model with
    residual "skip" connections.

4. [[Results]]

    I find the model improves humans in two ways:
        It's twice as accurate.
        It's 3X as reliable.

    I also find that most people are interested in having a machine
    help them grade cards.

    This implies we can make automated card grading accessible to people,
    improving the accuracy and reliability of everyday transactions.

5. [[Demo]]

    At its base, users can upload a card and get a quick "good-enough"
    estimate of its condition (show). They can also directly scrape
    the picture from an ecommerce auction, and in the future this could
    be integrated into an ecommerce platform.

    There are several additional features, including:
    - A watermark to verify authenticity of the grade. 
    - The ability to use a random example card as a demo.
    - A (beta) feature to see what the model sees.
    - Some explanation of how to use and understand the model.

6. About me:

    My PhD project was "data mining the mind," asking what your large-scale
    online behavior says about you as a person. For example: do your 
    tweets predict decisions? Do your reddit posts predict mental illness?
    This involved scraping social media data at scale and teaching using
    models, often NLP, to predict facets of people's psychology.

    I feel this gives me particular strengths in NLP and data mining, but
    more broadly I have 5 years experience using ML and data science 
    techniques to work with millions-scale natural datasets and answer
    scientific questions.


Tagline brainstorming.
Now, trading card grading is COSTLY and IMPRECISE.
So I make more ACCURATE and LOW-COST trading card grading with AI.
The goal is to IMPROVE peer-to-peer trading card transactions.
