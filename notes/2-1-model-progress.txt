-- Tonight got a model with 64% accuracy going. Did it with extra 
basketball cards and fewer data augmentations.

-- TODO NEXT re-add the data augmentations which will help generalization.
Also re-add the extra basketball cards which should be done.

Have more basketball cards downloading on CPU instance. When done, add
those to cropped_images and retrain model on GPU instance, being sure
to first re-create the partition.

-- Never mind, the basketball alone is OK.
