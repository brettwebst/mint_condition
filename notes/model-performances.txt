Train 7 epochs on ~6k images from 5 classes (9, 7, 5, 3, 1).
Baseball only. Remove missing images. ResNet18
    Test accuracy ~43%.
    (note: ran 12 epochs total and bottoms out...)

Training overnight: The same model on all sports.
5 classes (9, 7, 5, 3, 1)
All sports. Remove missing images. ResNet18

    Accuracy 62.38% and may be better , I only gave it 10 epochs.
    May gain a percentage or two with more training

Running Wednesday in cloud: ResNet with more rotations,
more epochs (15) and better reshaping to preserve X, Y axis order.
Note that the train_ml_model function locally is slightly more up to date.
