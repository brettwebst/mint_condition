- predict grade.
- predict price? people want this.

===== Datasets of graded trading cards =======
Ebay has LOADS of trading cards. E.g. "sports trading cards" cateogory --
single has 14 million cards.
    Can filter by grade with usually 40m000+ examples per class 0-10.

    Finding API: 5,000 calls/day.
        - can refine by category, etc.

Craigslist is difficult. Requires natural language text filtering and lots of junk pictures -- e.g. a whole set.

COMC (comc.com/Cards/baseball) / PWCC (pwccmarketplace.com)
1.6 million cards with labels usually in title.
    Roberto Clemente [PSA 7 NM]
    Giancarlo Stanton [BGS 9.5 GEM Mint]

   Unclear if I can scrape. Disallows a lot but /card/ looks like I can scrape.


Beckett.com

    I think I can scrape. Disallows some stuff. But
    1.4 million unique items.

    search_new is OK
    /images/ is OK
