I have a model that works! On my GPU instance.

--- Log.
I'm using EBAY auctions not dealer data.
Getting high 40s test accuracy.
Can do better with:

    - More data (coming from CPU instance, downloading now)
    - Maybe regularization on the output layer.

--- Todo next.

    On CPU instance.
    zip -r cropped_imgs.zip cropped_imgs
    aws s3 cp cropped_imgs.zip s3://mintcondition/

    On GPU instance.
    aws s3 cp s3://cropped_imgs.zip .
    extract to data/cropped_imgs
    train ML model, may need more than 20 epochs. 

--- Tomorrow: take the WHOLE day off.

--- Monday before work:
    * Get the new model training on GPU.
    * A quick change would be to regularize the last layer with L2
        or dropout.
