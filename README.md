# Overview
There is $5 billion market for sports memorabilia every year, a large part of which are trading cards. The value of a card depends highly on its condition, yet existing ways to grade the condition of a card are not effective for most transactions. Amateurs are highly inaccurate at grading cards themselves, and expert annotations are too costly and time-intensive for the vast majority of transactions. The result is that millions of trading cards are simply sold as ungraded. To address this problem, MintCondition is a web application that automatically grades trading cards from a picture, aiming to put near-expert level accuracy within reach of everyday amateur transactions.
